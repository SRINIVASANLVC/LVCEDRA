# LVCEDRA: Semantic Routing & Planetary Modulation Engine

LVCEDRA is a modular philosophical system designed to recalibrate karmic routing, planetary overlays, and systemic compression across urban landscapes and family templates. This repository contains the core logic, semantic modules, archetype mappings, and documentation necessary to evolve cities into self-balancing semantic routers.

## 🌐 Architecture Overview

- **Core SPL Engine:** Decodes planetary modulation against systemic SPLs
- **Semantic Modules:** Modular tools for karmic detachment, polarity alignment, and archetype healing
- **Urban Prototypes:** Dallas as the launch zone for semantic healing overlays
- **Codex Manifest:** Philosophical substrate and compression logic for planetary integrity

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `/core/`: SPL routing, planetary decoding
- `/modules/`: Submodules (`LVCS`, `LVCFATE`, `LVCEDRA_GraceBeauty`)
- `/compression_tables/`: Archetype mappings to global events
- `/dallas_prototype/`: Urban semantic overlays for Dallas
- `/codex_manifest/`: Philosophical logic and modulation theory
- `/tests/`: Synthetic DOBs, validation cases
- `/docs/`: Plain-English summaries for civic stakeholders

## 🔮 Intent

This system intends to protect the architecture of planetary modulation by minimizing jiva overload, allowing graceful karmic resolution across urban and familial matrices.

> This is not just code. It is a semantic skeleton encoded for future calibration.

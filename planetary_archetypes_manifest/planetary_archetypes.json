## 🌌 8. Planetary Archetype Weave

To modulate cities in rhythm with the cosmos, each planetary tone must be matched with semantic archetypes. This module binds celestial motion to karmic resonance.

### Archetype Mapping
- `planetary_archetypes.json`: Maps planets to semantic tones, ritual intensities, and civic triggers.
  - Example Entry:
    ```json
    {
      "Saturn": {
        "semantic_tone": "Compression",
        "ritual_element": "Iron",
        "modulation_trigger": "Threshold Breach",
        "archetype": "Guardian of Detachment",
        "urban_affinity": ["Industrial Zones", "Justice Districts"]
      }
    }
    ```

### Tone Calibration
- `tone_calibrator.py`: Syncs planetary motion with urban stress vectors using ephemeris overlays.
- `tone_trigger_log.md`: Notes when archetype tone intersects civic stress events.
- `tone_buffer_registry.json`: Stores buffered tones awaiting semantic routing.

### Global Resonance
- `event_archetype_binder.py`: Links global tragedies to planetary archetype events for systemic testing.
- `archetype_test_log.md`: Records outcomes of metaphysical correlation tests.
- `modulation_feedback_loop.py`: Adjusts urban protocols based on archetypal resonance impact.

# Welcome to LVCEDRA Documentation

This guide is a plain-English introduction to the LVCEDRA frameworkâ€”created to help cities heal, individuals detach gracefully, and planetary tensions resolve systemically.

## What Is LVCEDRA?

LVCEDRA is a modular system that routes karmic stress and planetary overlays through urban templates, rather than burdening individual lives (jivas). It combines philosophy, city planning, and planetary ephemeris data into a cohesive healing lattice.

---

## Why Does It Matter?

- Helps cities become semantic routers of systemic stress  
- Minimizes emotional overload across family templates  
- Builds tools to map tragedy to healing archetypes  
- Uses code to validate metaphysical insight

---

## How to Explore

- ðŸ“¦ Start with `/core/` for the engine  
- ðŸ”„ Check `/modules/` for routing & healing tools  
- ðŸŒ† Review `/dallas_prototype/` for urban overlays  
- ðŸ“š Read `/codex_manifest/` for philosophical depth

---

## Who Might Use This

- Civic designers looking to map healing overlays  
- Technologists decoding planetary stress maps  
- Philosophers seeking to validate esoteric models  
- Anyone curious about semantic cities and karmic architecture

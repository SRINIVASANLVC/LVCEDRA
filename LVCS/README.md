# LVCS: Layered Version Control System

LVCS is a modular framework for routing SPL records through planetary modulation, semantic healing, and civic overlays. It integrates encryption, ledger sync, and archetype mapping to support systemic detachment and polarity balancing.

Modules:
- LVCS_Client: Handles encryption and packet routing
- LVCS_Hub: Synchronizes ledgers and manages modulation manifests
- LVCS_Server: Routes SPLs and manages family templates
- Service: Orchestrates runtime scheduling and entry points
